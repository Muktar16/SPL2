this has been a very quiet morning for tanking, no issues that the team's working weather is set at, currently at 70%chances of having good conditions at liftoff time This is the Vehicle Assembly Building, that is where the shuttle gets put together and then it rolls out, a couple ofmiles, out to where the shuttle pad is That's pad 39a... shuttle Atlantis is on there, is on there, waiting to take off final inspection team and close out crew have entered the pad.   *copy that* final inspection team is complete andwe'll be rolling back to AB11 Did we get everything?    *Yes sir* Inspection complete, we are departing the pad copy departing the pad, and just head up Tom, flight crew has... are in the process of departing the LMC at this time, you guys might make it without having to pull over but I'll need you to be advised that they are in route to the pad and here comes our STS-132 Atlantis crew *cheering from crowd* so with that, the Astro Van now will proceed on out to Pad 39a there they go, and they'll be escorted out to the pad by a NASA security van, as is customary,behind them the inspection team is on the way back from the pad in their vehicles, I don't think think the two will pass, but it will be close the landing aids at the shuttle landing facility are about to be activatedshould a return to a landing site be necessary this afternoon The Astro Van now arriving arriving at the pad and going up the incline the ramp, on the way up to the pad's surface the crew compartment reports that theyare ready for the astronauts' ingress The crew may pause for a moment to take a look at Atlantis before they head up the elevator and that's exactly what they'redoing that shot there, looking up the side ofthe flame trench to the crew on the pad surface and we're at t-minus three hours andholding with an hour two minutes 50 seconds remaining in his built-in hold here are the astronauts now, getting offthe elevator ready to cross the orbiter access arm and our commander Ken Ham being assisted with his launch and entry suit prior to boarding Atlantis to be our first crew member aboard today here we see our Commander being seated in the cockpit and Mission Specialist #3, Steve Bowen,being assisted with his launch an entry suit Steve Bowen now confirmed to be aboard Atlantis at this time Tony Antonelli, our pilot, will be boarding next Piers Sellers, is Mission Specialist #4 ready for his entry into the crewcompartment next to board, is Mission Specialist #1, aboard Atlantis on STS-132. Yes, so we're three hours from launch, just a little under, and so some of these guys have already been sitting on their back for a little while. I guess when you can't turn your head, can't move around, a mirror is not a bad thing to have and Mike Good, who you'll hear called "Bueno" on the loops during the mission that crew has actually been working with these guys all through training they are assigned, kind of, to the crew when the crew is assigned, and they show up at all the training events where they're suited andkind of go through the whole choreography every single time, make sure the suits are fitting just right Mike Good coming into view in the MS 2 seat, and Chris Cassidy will start working on him here shortly yes with the exception of the commander and pilot and MS2, most of the guys areup and moving around very very quickly and actually the guys down in themid-deck will be getting out of the A-suits (Ascent suits), pretty quickly after getting an eight-and-a-half minute ride to orbit you can see the hatch there withAtlantis written down the side SRO?  SRO is go, you have range clear to launch... and CDR?  (CDR is Commander) (CDR) Atlantis is Go and NTD Launch Director you're clear tolaunch Atlantis Copy that Launch Director Go for Orbiter Access Armretract. Atlantis crew, our team has worked hard and it's with great pride that wesend the first "Last Crew" on Atlantis to the International Space Station with themini research module to be installed t-minus two minutes and counting. Atlantis, close and lock your visors and initiate O2 OTC, that is "in work" the ground launch sequencer will hand off to Atlantis' onboard flight computer, 15 seconds from now firing chain is armed, sound suppressionwater system activated t-minus 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, go for main engine start, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 lift off, of space shuttle Atlantis Houston, Atlantis is in the roll roger roll Atlantis Houston is now controlling Atlantis is in a 'heads down' position, on course for a 51.6 degree 136 by 36 statute mile orbit you can hear the roar! the three main engines on Atlantis have now been throttled down to 72% of rated thrust As the orbiter prepares to pass through the area of maximum dynamic pressure on the vehiclein the lower atmosphere there you get the arc(as the vehicle builds lateral speed) engines now beginning to throttle back up Atlantis, you are GO at throttle up Copy, GO at throttle up all three engines looking really goodback at full throttle now at liftoff, the fully fueled shuttle, boosters and external tank weighed four and a half million pounds, has now burned half of that lift-off weight in propellent Atlantis is already 19 miles in altitude, downrange from the Kennedy Space Center 20 miles, traveling 2,500 miles per hour coming up on staging the point at whichthe twin solid rocket boosters burn out and separate from the orbiter booster separation confirmed the onboard guidance system has done its job of settling out any of the dispersions that have been introduced atthe booster separation Atlantis is traveling 3,700 miles perhour, at an altitude of 47 miles this view from a camera on the externaltank looking down the length of the orbiter you can still see that littledot, wow! Still there, that is wild you can still, if you know where to look you can still see that dot going. Atlantis, you are single-engine OPS 3 Copy, Single Engine OPS 3. That roll the heads-up provides a good satellite communications link to with Atlantis continuing its travel into space you are press to MECO and single-engineZaragoza 104. Copy, press to MECO and single engine Zaragosa 104. Scorch, I got the roll!  *Lucky dog!* Atlantis copies, nominal shutdown, go for the plus x, go for the pitch. Still going *splashing water echo sounds* Atlantis is now travelling 13,000 milesper hour 580 miles away from the Kennedy Space Center at an altitude of 340,000 feet Atlantis can reach orbit on one enginenow, should two fail, however all three are still in good shape. Atlantis istraveling 15,500 miles per hour approaching eight minutesinto the flight, downrange 740 miles at an altitude of 64 miles plasma? oh! are they burning out, MECO? main engine cutoff confirmed, standing by for separation from the external fuel tank There they go! they're separating Atlantis now flying away from theexternal tank, after separation plus x burn maneuver beingperformed by a Commander Ken Ham nominal MECO, OMS 1 not required, preliminary OMS 2 TIG will be 37:30 Wow! look at at that! awesome welcome back to space for you, and yourveteran crew Copy, 37:30 it's good to be back Scorch, as you know, and OMS 1 is not required! as is typical with all Space Shuttle missions, the crew rapidlygets out their handheld camera and takes them still and motion video of theexternal tank as it drifts away from the shuttle this gives the ground teams an idea of exactly how the foam on the externaltank faired, to make sure that all of it stayed in its proper position if you look down, with these binoculars, at one spot on the ground *yes*We are going absolutely ludicrous speed ludicrous speed!we have achieved ludicrous speed Distortion speed, if you were down there in an airplane you would be a cinder! This is ridiculous how fast we're going! you can see some of the the cryogenics from inside that tank still venting as thetank separated from space shuttle Atlantis that tank also has what are known astumble jets installed on it, that enable the tank to basically flip end over end, to ensure that it actually breaks up as expected as it goes back down into theEarth's atmosphere and disintegrates and wow, what a ride, I was really digging, like, no master cautions that was a cool thing yeah... not a one, nothing!We appreciate all the folks working the ball bearings down in that MCC and LCCget us off the pad! Incorrect Date of Launch, was 2010
