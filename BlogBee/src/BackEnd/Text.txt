Hi there, I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse: World History and today we’re going to talk about Islam, which like Christianityand Judaism grew up on the east coast of the Mediterranean but unlike Christianity andJudaism is not terribly well understood in the West. For instance, you probably knowwhat this is and what this is, you probably don’t know what that is. Google it. Mr. Green Mr. Green why do you think peopleknow so little about Islamic history? Did you just ask an interesting non-annoyingquestion, me from the past? I think we don’t know about early Islamic history because wedon’t learn about it, me from the past, because we don’t learn about it, becausewe’re taught that our history is the story of Christianity in Europe, when in fact ourhistory is the story of people on the planet, so let’s try to learn something today. [theme music] So in less than 200 years Islam went fromnot existing to being the religious and political organizing principal of one of the largestempires in the world. And that story begins in the 7th century CEwhen the angel Gabriel appeared to Muhammad, a 40-ish guy who made his living as a caravantrader and told him to begin reciting the word of God. Initially, this freaked Muhammad out, as,you know, it would—but then his wife and a couple of other people encouraged him andslowly he came to accept the mantle as prophet. A few things to know about the world Islamentered: First, Muhammad’s society was intensely tribal. He was a member of the Quraysh tribe,living in Mecca and tribal ties were extremely important. Also, at the time, the Arabian peninsula waslike this crazy religious melting pot. Like most tribal Arabs worshipped gods very similar to theMesopotamian gods you’ll remember from episode 3. And by the time of Muhammad, cult statutesof many of those gods had been collected in his hometown of Mecca in this temple-likestructure called the Kaaba. But Arabia was also a home for monotheismslike Christianity and Judaism, even a bit of Zoroastrianism. So the message that therewas only god wouldn’t have been like as surprising to Muhammad as it was, for instance,to Abraham. Also, and this will become very important,the northern part of Arabia was sandwiched between the Byzantine Empire and the PersianSassanian Empire—and you’ll remember, those guys were always fighting. They werelike snowboarders and skiers, or like the Westboro Baptist Church and everyone else. At its core, Islam is what we call a radicalreforming religion—just like Jesus and Moses sought to restore Abrahamic monotheism afterwhat they perceived as straying, so too did Muhammad. Muslims believe that God sent Muhammad asthe final prophet to bring people back to the one true religion, which involves the worship of,and submission to, a single and all-powerful God. The Quran also acknowledges Abraham and Mosesand Jesus among others as prophets, but it’s very different from the Hebrew and Christianbibles: For one thing it’s much less narrative,but also its the written record of the revelations Muhammadreceived—which means its not written from the point of view of people, it is seen asthe actual word of God. The Quran is a really broad-ranging text,but it returns again and again to a couple themes. One is strict monotheism and the otheris the importance of taking care of those less fortunate than you. The Quran, says ofthe good person spends his substance—however much he himselfmay cherish it—upon his near of kin, and the orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer,and the beggars, and for the freeing of human beings from bondage. These revelations also radically increasedthe rights of women and orphans, which was one of the reasons why Mohammad’s triballeaders weren’t that psyched about them. To talk more about Islamic faith and practice,let’s go to the Thought Bubble. The five pillars of Islam are the basic actsconsidered obligatory, at least by Sunni Muslims. First is the shahada or the profession ofthe faith: There is no god but god and Muhammad is God’sprophet, which is sometimes translated as “There is no god but Allah and Muhammadis Allah’s prophet”, which tries to make Muslims sound other and ignores the fact thatthe Arabic word for god—whether you are Christian or Jewish or Muslim—is Allah. Second, salat, or ritual prayer five timesa day—at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and late evening—which are obligatory unlessyou haven’t hit puberty, are too sick, or are menstruating. Keep it PG, Thought Bubble. Third, sawm, the month-long fast during themonth of Ramadan, in which Muslims do not eat or drink or smoke cigarettes during daylighthours. Since Ramadan is a lunar-calendar month, itmoves around the seasons, and obviously it’s most fun during the winter, when days areshorter, and least fun during the summer, when days are both long and hot. Fourth is zakat, or almsgiving, in which non-poorMuslims are required to give a percentage of their income to the poor, and lastly hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca thatMuslims must try to fulfill at least once in their lives, provided they are healthyand have enough money. And there’s also more to understanding Islamthan just knowing the Quran. Like Judaism with its Talmud, and Christianity with itslives of saints and writings of Church fathers, Islam has supplementary sacred texts, chiefamong which is the hadith, a collection of sayings and stories about the Prophet. Thanks Thought Bubble. Oh, it’s time forthe open letter? Magic. An Open Letter to the 72 Virgins. Oh, butfirst let’s check what’s in the Secret Compartment. Huh, it’s Andre the Giant.Did you know that Andre the Giant died a virgin- is a fact that I made up? Dear 72 Virgins, Hey there, it’s me, John Green. Did youknow that not all hadiths were created equal? Some sayings of the Prophet are really wellsourced. like for instance, a good friend or a relative heard the Prophet say somethingand then it ended up as a hadith. But some hadiths are terribly sourced like,not to be irreverent, but some of it is like middle school gossip; like Rachel told Rebekahthat her sister’s brother’s friend kissed Justin Bieber on the face. And the vast majority of Muslims don’t treatterribly sourced hadiths as scripture. And the idea that you go to heaven and get72 virgins is not in the Quran; it’s in a terribly sourced hadith so it is my greatregret to inform you, 72 Virgins, that in the eyes of almost all Muslims you do notexist. Best wishes,John Green One more thing about Islam: Like Christianityand Judaism, it has a body of law. You might have heard of it - it’s called sharia. Although we tend to think of sharia as thissingle set of laws that all Muslims follow, that’s ridiculous; there are numerous competinginterpretations of sharia, just as there are within any legal tradition. So people who embraced this worldview werecalled Muslims, because they submitted to the will of God, and they became part of theumma, or community of believers. This would be a good moment for an Uma Thurmanjoke, but sadly she is no longer famous. I’m sorry if you’re watching this, Uma Thurman. Being part of the umma trumped all other ties,including tribal ties, which got Muhammad into some trouble and brings us, at last,back to history. So as Muhammad’s following in Mecca grew,the umma aroused the suspicion of the most powerful tribe, the Quraysh. And it didn’t matter that Muhammad himselfwas born into the Quraysh tribe because he wouldn’t shut up about how there was onlyone God, which was really bad news to the Quraysh tribe because they managed the pilgrimagetrade in Mecca, and if all those gods were false, it would be a disaster economically. —although come to think of it, in the end theMeccan pilgrimage business turned out just fine. So the Quraysh forced Muhammad and his followersout of Mecca in 622 CE, and they headed to Yithrab, also known as Medina. This journey, also know as the hijra, is soimportant that it marks year 0 in the Islamic calendar. In Medina, Muhammad severed the religion’sties to Judaism, turning the focus of prayer away from Jerusalem to Mecca. Also in Medina, the Islamic community startedto look a lot more like a small empire than like a church. Like, Jesus never had a countryto run. But Muhammad did almost from the beginning.And in addition to being an important prophet, he was a good general and in 630, the Islamiccommunity took back Mecca. They destroyed the idols in the kabaa, andsoon Islam was as powerful a political force in the region as it was a religious one. And it’s because the political and religiouscoexisted from the beginning, that there’s no separate tradition of civic and religiouslaw like there is in Christianity and Judaism. very different from Judaism and even fromChristianity—which you’ll remember debated very different from Judaism and even fromChristianity—which you’ll remember debated for generations whether to be inclusive. —and more importantly than separating Islamfrom other monotheisms, that really separated Islam from the tribalism in Arabia. So then when Muhammad died in 632 CE, therewasn’t a religious vacuum left behind: Muhammad was the final prophet, the revelation of the Quran wouldcontinue to guide the umma throughout their lives. But the community did need a political leader,a caliph. And the first caliph was Abu Bakr, Muhammad’s father-in-law, who was not withouthis opponents: Many people wanted Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law,to lead the community. And although he did become the fourth caliph, that initial disagreement — toradically oversimplify because we only have ten minutes — began the divide between thetwo of the major sects of Islam: Suuni and Shi’a. And even today, Sunnis Muslims believe AbuBakr was rightly elected the first caliph and Shi’a Muslims believe it should’vebeen Ali. To Sunnis, the first four caliphs—Abu Bakr,Umar, Uthman, and Ali— are known as the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and many of the conservativemovements in the Islamic world today are all about trying to restore the Islamic worldto those glory days, which—like most glory days—were not unambiguously glorious. Abu Bakr stabilized the community after Muhammad’sdeath, and began the process of recording the Quran in writing, And started the military campaigns againstthe Byzantine and Sassanian Empires that within 116 years would allow the Islamic Empire togo from this to this. His successor Umar was both an uncommonlygood general and a brilliant administrator but like so many other great men, he provedterrible at avoiding assassination. Which led to the caliphate of Uthman, whostandardized the Quran and continued both his predecessor’s tradition of conquestand his predecessor’s tradition of getting assassinated. Then Ali finally got his turn at caliph, buthis ascension was very controversial, and it ultimately led to a civil war. Which eventually led to the emergence of Uthman’stribe, the Umayyads, as the dynasty ruling over an ever-expanding Islamic Empire formore than a hundred years. It’s common to hear that in these earlyyears Islam quote spread by the sword, and that’s partly true, unless you are — waitfor it — the Mongols. Actually, as usual, the truth is more complicated:Manypeople, including the Mongols but also including lots of people in Central and East Asia, embracedIslam without any military campaigns. And in fact, the Quran says that religionmust not be an act of compulsion, but this much is true: The early Islamic empire wasreally good at winning wars. And situated as they were between two verywealthy empires—the Byzantines and the Sassanians—there was plenty to fight for. First to fall was the Sassanians, the lastnon-Muslim successor to the Persian Empire. They were relatively easy pickings becausethey’d been fighting the Byzantines for like 300 years and were super tired. Alsothey’d been recently struck by plague. Plague, man, I’m telling you; It’s likethe red tortoise shell of history. But in those early days they did pry awaysome valuable territory like Egypt and the holy land and eventually they got into Spain. Where various Muslim dynasties would entrenchthemselves until being expelled in 1492. But as a good as they were at making war,it’s still tempting to chalk up the Arabs’ success to, you know, the will of God. And certainly a lot of the people they conqueredfelt that way. Wars in this part of the world didn’t just pit people against each other,they also pitted their gods against each other. So while the Islamic Empire didn’t requireits subjects to convert to Islam, their stunning successes certainly convinced a lot of peoplethat this monotheism thing was legit. Once again, John Green proving super hip tothe slang of today’s young’ns. Also, you paid lower taxes if you converted,and just as taxes on cigarettes lead to people not wanting to smoke, taxes on worshiping your idolslead to people not wanting to worship them anymore. So in a period of time that was, historicallyspeaking, both remarkably recent and remarkably short, a small group of people from an areaof the world with no natural resources managed to create one of the great empires of theworld and also one of its great religions. And that very fact may be why people ofWestern European descent remain largely ignorant about this period. Not only were the Muslims great conquerors,they spawned an explosion of trade and learning that lasted hundreds of years. They saved many of the classical texts thatform the basis of the “Western Canon” while Europe was ignoring them and they pavedthe way for the Renaissance. While it’s important to remember that muchof the world between Spain and the Indus River wasn’t Arabized, most of it was so thoroughlyIslamized that these days we can’t think of the world we now call the Middle East withoutthinking of it as Islamic. Perhaps the greatest testimony to Islam’spower to organize peoples lives and their communities is that, in Egypt, 5 times a day millions ofpeople turn away from the Pyramids and toward Mecca. Egypt, birthplace to one of the longest continuouscultures the world has ever known, is now the largest Arab country in the world.
