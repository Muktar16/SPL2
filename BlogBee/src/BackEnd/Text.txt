Thank you to KiwiCo for supporting PBS. As a wildlife ecologist, I’ve spent hoursfollowing bear tracks around Nevada and New York, hoping for a glimpse of these furry,four-legged, foragers. Though, if we look across the whole animalkingdom, we’d find all kinds of bears. Bears with four legs, eight legs, six legs,or no legs! Some weighing over 1000 pounds, and othersthat are microscopic with very few, or even no, organs at all.  Even bears that can walk on paws or suctiondisks, fly, or sway in the ocean currents. I’m talking about grizzly bears, but alsowater bears, bear moths, and pore bearers. It’s not always clear why such a diversearray of animals became associated with an Old English or proto-German word for a browncreature...  [or why we thought that pore bearer pun was a good idea!] Like water bears look kinda like 8 leggedgrizzlies. But bear moths spend most of their lives asfuzzy caterpillars, and pore- bear-ers is a translation for the phylum Porifera thatjust contains sponges. None of those look like bears!   Turns out, “bears” come in all sorts ofsizes and body plans, and vary a ton in how they move.  And we’ll see that even though animals canlook very, very different on their surface, there are surprising similarities in how they’veevolved to solve major problems -- like how to support and move their bodies!  I’m Rae Wynn-Grant, and this is Crash CourseZoology.  INTRO An animal’s size and body plan shape theirentire lives -- what they eat and how much, how they move, where they live, and theirplace in their environment. Like the grizzly and black bears I study carrytheir 1000 pounds of muscle and fur around on four paws. They spend most of the fall fattening up forthe winter, and unlike most four-legged mammals, they can stand up and sit like us! But animals come in a huge range of sizes,and most animals are actually very small compared to us. A human like me weighs about 59 kilograms,which is about 59,000 times more than a house spider. And a blue whale can weigh 100 million timesmore than that spider. Even the animals that get big as adults -- andby “big” I mean more than a couple inches long -- spend a good part of their life beingvery small, undergoing drastic changes in body shape and lifestyle as they grow.   For instance, some fish, amphibians, reptiles,sponges, corals, and mollusks gain both weight and length for their entire lives -- thisis called indeterminate growth. Some animals have periodic growth, alternatingbetween growing fast and slow (or not at all). Like animals with exoskeletons, or hard outerskeletons. During molting when an animal sheds its oldskin or shell, these animals actually grow their new exoskeleton under their old oneand then inflate it with fluid before it eventually hardens into their new larger size! Other animals experience predetermined growthand stop growing when they hit a more-or-less maximum size. But once any animal reaches a certain size,they hit some physical limitations. Animals thicker than about 1 millimeter needextra plumbing like a cardiovascular system to move oxygen and waste around their bodies. Bigger animals also need to eat a lot moreto feed their 1000s or millions or even trillions of cells.  And big animals need more structure like bonesand muscles to support them as gravity pulls on all their weight. That’s why the biggest animals, the whales,live in the ocean -- the water supports their bodies instead of legs.  Growing also means making new tissue, andanimals have evolved a few different solutions. Many clades, or groups of animals with a commonancestor, add more cells. Other animals grow by making each cell biggerbut keeping the same number of cells, a trait called eutely. Other animals like echinoderms use a weirdprocess called maximal indirect development and grow their adult form out of a specialball of cells that have been set-aside.  The larval or immature form is mostly madeup of cells that already have all their development planned out for them, and a set amount ofgrowing they’re going to do. But in the larvae, there’s also a smallamount of set-aside cells that take over once the other cells get old and die off. Then the ball of set-aside cells develop intothe many cell types needed to create the adult form. But the growth that probably seems the wildestto us humans is colonial growth when animals get bigger by adding more complete, individualclones.  These colonial animals, like Siphonophoresand Bryozoans, are made up of tons of little clones that work together, sort of like howa school of fish can coordinate and swim together.  But even though animals can grow in completelydifferent ways, a lot of them can look quite similar.  Basically, some body designs show up againand again. Distantly related animals evolving similartraits independently is called convergent evolution, and it usually happens becausedifferent lineages face similar problems in their environment or take on similar ecologicalniches. One of the most stunning examples of convergentevolution is carcinization, a process that zoologist Lancelot A. Borradaile famouslydefined as "the many attempts of Nature to evolve a crab.” Let’s go to the Thought Bubble. It all started with the cycloids, a groupof arthropods that lived from the Carboniferous to the Cretaceous era. They had that flat crabby shape, a small abdomen,and a bunch of walking legs just like today’s crabs.  It wasn’t until the early Jurassic period,tens of millions years after the first cycloids were around, that the first of what we thinkof as real crabs -- members of infraorder Brachyura -- showed up.  A little after that is when the fake crabsstarted showing up, with things like this early squat lobster all looking very crabby. And the crab fad kept happening over the Mesozoicera -- now we have hermit crabs, hairy stone crabs, horseshoe crabs, crab lice, and kingcrabs. None of which are descended from Brachyuransand so none of which are actual crabs! One way you can tell is that most “fakecrabs” have six walking legs instead of eight! But why? Probably because “crab” is a great body plan. It’s tough and adaptable to life on landor in water, and their flat and round bodies fit into more places than a long lobster tailmight. So crab-shaped animals have more evolutionaryfitness, which means they tend to survive and pass on their genes more than non-crabshapes.  The real kicker is that the cycloids -- theones who first came up with the crab body plan -- died out in the Cretaceous era, ata time when there were real crabs and fake crabs all over the place. One hypothesis is that the cycloids got outcompeted-- out-carcinized, out crabbed -- by both the crabs and “crabs” we know today! Thanks Thought Bubble! Convergent evolution pops up when a similarsolution works in different environments for different lineages. Animals’ bodies evolve to better suit afunction -- even if it means turning into a crab. Now it’s important to remember that evolutionhas no set goals besides passing on genes -- there’s no “body plan plan.” Often a simpler form can perform a functionmuch better than a complex one! Cephalization -- evolving a head -- and insome cases, decephalization -- or evolving to not have a head -- are good examples ofhow sometimes simpler is better. But like what is a head, really? Heads collect the sense organs needed to perceivethe world, the mouth, and the nerve cells that coordinate them in the front of the animal,where they can react quickly to danger or prey.  We know that the ancestor of all the animalsthat can be divided into symmetrical halves, which are called Bilaterians for their bilateralsymmetry, had a head. And most animals are bilaterians.  But some animal groups have lost their heads-- literally -- because they became less useful. Like bivalve mollusks, like clams, are bilateriansthat stay rooted in one place and just filter water through their mouths to catch bits offood. Which you don’t really need a dedicatedhead for, so the “head pieces” like the central nervous system and sensory organs,are distributed around the clams’ body. Other animals with radial symmetry have bodiesthat are symmetric around a central point. Most of these are echinoderms, and with theexception of sea cucumbers, they don’t have anything resembling a head. But heads or no head, bilaterally or radiallysymmetrical, for all these forms to be possible, they need some kind of structural support-- otherwise everything turns into a blob of cells.  Phylum Chordata solves this with a notochord,a flexible rod that supports their body as embryos and sometimes as adults. The notochord develops into the vertebralcolumn, or spinal column, in vertebrates, which is where they get their name. All other animals are invertebrates, and theyhave several different types of support -- which is part of the reason they don’t form justone phylum. In general, skeletons are frameworks thatsupport, shape, and protect soft tissues. When you think of a skeleton, you probablypicture an endoskeleton, an internal support structure made of mineralized tissues. Vertebrates have rigid endoskeletons madeof bone, which gets its hardness from large amounts of calcium phosphate.  Invertebrates have endoskeletons made fromother materials. Like echinoderms such as sea urchins haveendoskeletons made from fused plates called ossicles, which are made of calcite.  Even sponges have an endoskeleton made ofthe flexible protein spongin and spicule crystals. But some sponges also secrete an outer skeletonfrom cells on their skin, which leads us to exoskeletons -- skeletons that sit outsidethe rest of the body!   Mineralized exoskeletons show up in at least18 clades, including some sponges, echinoderms, corals, and mollusks.  Other animals based their exoskeletons onlong chains of sugar molecules, called polysaccharides.  Arthropods like insects, crustaceans, andarachnids use chitin to make their skeletons.  The third type of exoskeleton is actuallymade of water. Which sounds rather...flimsy. But hydroskeletons work because water is incompressible-- you can’t realistically squeeze it into a smaller volume like you could a marshmallow.  So as long as animals can contain water ina tube or sac, they’ve got the makings of a stable structure.  Invertebrates like worms and jellyfish usehydroskeletons to support their very flexible bodies.  It’s an especially great adaptation forliving deep in the ocean.  Endo-, exo-, and hydroskeletons -- plus headswhen animals have them -- are what give animals their shape. But animals aren’t statues like you’dsee in a museum -- they move, and how animals move also influences how they look. Some animals move with the help of their environment-- spiders cartwheel down sand dunes, and Velella velella, a jellyfish-like colony ofanimals, use a sail to catch the breeze. These animals needed to evolve the right instinctsand structures to take advantage of their surroundings. Other animals move under their own power withthe help of cilia and muscles. Cilia and flagella are hair- or tail shapedparts of cells that beat in co-ordinated waves to paddle microscopic animals forward. And how these tissues connect with the skeletoninfluences how an animal moves.  Moving an entire skeleton at once is harder,because they're usually rigid and heavy. Most animals solve this by turning their skeletonsinto a bunch of levers that pivot around joints as pairs of muscles contract and relax.  Even animals with hydroskeletons use musclesto control fluid pressure and bend their body.  Animals move their bodies in all sorts ofways, balancing where they want to go, how quickly, and how much energy it’ll take. In fact, there’s a whole field of zoologycalled biomechanics that’s interested in how mechanical principles guide how animalsare shaped and move.  But all this moving and growing takes a tremendousamount of energy, and we’ll talk more about where animals find that energy in our nextepisode. Evolution is a wild journey that brings usso many different animals with a huge array of bodies and sizes. That is, until everything turns into a crab. Thank you to KiwiCo for supporting PBS.
