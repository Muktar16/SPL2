this video is brought to you by morningbrew hi welcome to another episode of cold fusion where i cover anything in science technology business or history during the dawn of the computing age ibm was a technology giant once dubbed big blue the scale of the company was massive at one stage consisting of sixty to seventy percent of all business computers in circulation but today it's a completely different story ibm was a major innovator they invented the atm floppy disk hard drive magnetic strip card and dram to name a few you may not also know that earlier this year ibm after over a century of operation has now split into two companies so the main question does have to be asked why don't we all have ibm computers and smartphones today what happened to ibm this is the rise and stagnation of ibm you are watching cold fusion tv international business machines or ibm for short was founded in 1911. in this year three companies the computing scale company the tabulating machine company and the time recording company merged the products of ibm's early days were quite interesting they included electronic tabulating machines and clocks that could record on punch cards when workers entered work but also stranger products like meat and cheese slices by the mid-1930s ibm's electronic tabulating products helped companies deal with huge amounts of data so soon government began looking to ibm services in 1937 the us government used the technology to keep the employment records of 26 million americans in a much less mundane and tragic use of the technology the nazis used ibm technology to keep track of jews through a german ibm branch [Music] when the horror of war was over ibm would go from strength to strength the company would introduce the world to the hard disk drive the 305 ramak it stored a total of 5 megabytes but it looked like this yes it had to be moved with forklifts and transported by cargo planes the data was stored on large spinning platters that retrieved the information with a magnetic arm in the same year the company would demonstrate the earliest practical form of artificial intelligence arthur l samuel of ibm's new york lab programmed an ibm 704 that could play checkers but not only this it could learn from its own experience sure it was primitive but it showed that it was possible for computers to learn before this nobody knew if this was truly possible in the 1960s ibm partnered a lot with nasa including the 1969 moon mission and the apollo guidance computers in 1964 ibm's innovation continued with the release of the ibm system 360. it was a family of mainframe computers whose product line had enough options for both large and small firms as well as commercial and scientific applications some of the most powerful models could do 16.6 million instructions per second and featured one megabyte of memory the ibm 360 solved a problem that had begun to happen in the industry see when a company bought a new computer they would use it until its capacity filled up but the problem was it was unupgradable the company's only option was to get a bigger system the issue was all the software had to be rewritten because of incompatibilities and this was expensive so ibm came up with a solution of making a family of computer where all the code worked between them without any issues it wasn't easy though in researching for the system ibm spent the equivalent of 40 billion dollars more than they made in an entire year there were problems with production and there was much infighting within the company many internally thought that this would be the end of ibm fortunately for them though the ibm 360 became a smash hit and it propelled ibm to become the world's largest computer company and it single-handedly caused a steep rise in hardware sales at this point they were the only significant maker of computers and had a strong monopoly in the market going even further with their influence over technology the company also developed the computer language fortran this language was the precursor to 700 programming languages that are used all over the globe today interestingly fortran which is the world's oldest commercial programming language is still being used by nasa scientists and others at the department of energy over 64 years after its inception and here's why according to tom cloon who works at nasa quote fortran has exceptionally good built-in support for numerical calculations and array manipulation which is particularly important for scientists and engineers python and java are generally perceived as being slower with such a rich history at this point you'd think that ibm would have gone on to dominate the pc market i mean today everyone should have an ibm pc in their home and possibly an ibm smartphone in their hand but obviously this never happened so what went wrong well it all went south for ibm in the 1980s just as the personal computing revolution was beginning to grow with the release of the apple ii in 1977 computers went from a tool for business and governments to a very powerful tool for personal use overnight whole industries were turned upside down on the 12th of august 1981 in a manhattan hotel ibm unveiled the company's entrance into this new industry it was called the ibm pc welcome to the exciting new world of personal computers as the new user of an ibm personal computer system you now have one of the most powerful tools modern technology can provide you'll learn how a microprocessor performs most of the same functions as a huge mainframe processor like those found in the big ibm type systems large corporations use there are quite a few new keys on your ibm personal computer that make it different from an ordinary typewriter at the time the press didn't really see what all the fuss was about but as it turned out the personal computer would possibly be the biggest technology revolution in a century when thinking about software for the new computer ibm had two choices a 24 year old nobody called bill gates who was recommended by a software engineer within ibm or gary kildoll the president of digital research the most well-known computer software company at the time if you watched my special episode on the story you would have seen how gary blew off ibm in what would become known as the biggest business blunder of the century i'll leave a link to it in the description it's a fascinating story that actually impacted the entire technology world as we know it today after the blunder ibm would choose to partner with bill gates and his small company microsoft would provide the software for the ibm pc unfortunately for ibm they made a massive error and did not secure the rights to the software that microsoft was going to make for their pc in their mind they didn't ever really think the pc was going to amount to much anyway but as it turned out loads of people wanted their own computer at first this was fine because the ibm pc would dominate in sales the company predicted 200 000 units in the first year but they were doing 200 000 units per month in its first year the ibm pc would generate 1 billion dollars in revenue and by 1984 the company was raking in 46 billion dollars but the glory wouldn't last for ibm seeing the dollar signs soon other manufacturers would begin to make their own computers and microsoft was more than happy to sell their software to all of them and this was when disaster began to strike for ibm why would anyone buy an ibm pc if they can get something that's cheaper and performs the same way in an instant ibm's competitive advantage was gone computer buyers began shopping elsewhere to stop the downward trend in 1987 ibm would put out their own operating system called os2 and this was to combat microsoft but by this stage windows had already been out for two years it was too little too late ibm had lost to the monster that they had created in bill gates their market share went from 80 in 1983 down to 20 in 1993. to make matters worse between 1991 and 1993 the company made a net loss of 16 billion dollars ibm's operating system os2 didn't catch on and was eventually killed in 1995. the managerial controls within ibm reportedly broke down many parts of the company no longer delivered revenue to support the structure of the entire firm even a special dividend which was usually reserved for widows and orphans pension funds could no longer be sustained because of the financial decline in this area of their history ibm proved to be too slow in reacting to the flood of competition as the 20th century drew to a close computers were trending towards becoming smaller faster and more efficient ibm's mainframes were fast becoming a thing of the past mainframes were replaced by small servers and this crippled ibm they were in no substantial position to cope with this change however in the super computing world they were still market leaders perhaps as a marketing stunt to prove that they weren't completely dead at the time ibm created deep blue a primitive ai that defeated the reigning chess champion gary kasparov in 1997 a result that many experts were surprised at despite this the downward trajectory was still happening although ibm's thinkpad lines of laptops would be well received it would all be too much and ibm's pc division was sold off to the chinese company lenovo in 2005 for 1.75 billion the ibm giant had fallen reluctantly ibm had to shift their business towards building networks and installing servers so the question that you might be asking yourself in this stage of the video is what on earth is ibm doing today [Music] the new century for ibm was a checkered one it could be summarized as doing a broad range of research and refocusing on their strength in terms of research the company actually holds the record for the most annual u.s patents and this has been going for 28 consecutive years in a row some research of the 2000s includes carbon nanotube transistors flexible transistors and ai out of all of these emerging fields quantum computing seems like ibm's best shot in 2019 ibm unveiled the queue system one the first circuit-based commercial quantum computer ibm provides software that can build quantum circuits and test them on real quantum hardware remotely clients can then access the computer over the cloud cern exxonmobil and fermilab are among some of the clients that have signed up to use the system remotely if you are a long-term subscriber you'd remember how quantum computers take advantage of some amazing physical properties found in quantum mechanics through manipulating these unique properties quantum computers one day will be able to do calculations that are impossible to run on devices today i've got a video on the surprising future applications of quantum computing so i'll leave a link below if you're interested ibm has partnered with some japanese companies and they've already identified some promising use cases mitsubishi chemicals research team has developed quantum algorithms capable of understanding the complex behavior of chemical compounds within oled displays a research paper by the scientists explains how this use of quantum computers could lead to more efficient displays requiring low power consumption according to zednet researchers from mitsubishi financial group have developed quantum algorithms that could speed up financial operations like monte carlo simulations optimized portfolio management and better risk analysis could result from this [Music] so what about the competition in the quantum computing sector what are some other companies doing the following information is from the newsletter morningbrew who sponsored this section google is dropping a few billion dollars to try and build the first ever commercial grade quantum computer by 2029 it could solve complex problems like creating a low co2 fertilizer alternative millions of times faster than a conventional computer dario gill director of ibm research believes that 2023 is going to be an inflection point where the errors of quantum computers will continue to decrease exponentially because of software as opposed to just the hardware if you want to see more stories like this and many others be sure to check out morning brew morning brew is a

technology made its way into the playstation 3 and xbox 360 back in the 2000s the company can also be accredited for creating the very first smartphone back in 1992 the ibm simon i've done a whole cold fusion episode on that one if you're interested in 2001 the company was sued by holocaust survivors for their technology being used in nazi germany the suits were eventually dropped during the 2008 financial crisis most companies got smashed in terms of share price ibm fed is significantly better than hewed packard cisco microsoft and oracle the growth was ignited by global i.t services accounting for roughly six billion dollars per year for ibm also providing numerous software solutions for both government and private industry proved to be very lucrative in 2019 the company purchased red hat for a staggering 34 billion dollars red hat provides cloud storage operating system platforms and even consulting services this acquisition was ibm's big bet on cloud computing industry observers noted that ibm is late to the cloud computing party and it's obvious that they're playing catch-up with these emerging technologies they have stiff competition with the likes of oracle google and amazon in october of 2020 after over a century of operation ibm broke into two the old ibm will now be known as kindrel and it's going to manage the legacy services of iit infrastructure the new ibm will use the red hat acquisition as a basis to build and focus on cloud computing and ai will it work who knows [Music] so there you go that's the story of one of the oldest computing companies in the entire globe even though they're trying to get their fingers in a lot of pies currently it's clear to see that ibm are no longer the innovators that they once were so what are your thoughts will they ever catch up to the modern players such as amazon google or oracle time will tell if ibm will ever rise again but it's unlikely that we'll ever see them dominate 80 percent of any market like they did in the early 1980s anyways that's about it from me thanks for watching the whole way through my name is tagogo and i'll see you again soon for the next episode cheers guys have a good one cold fusion it's me thinking [Music] you
