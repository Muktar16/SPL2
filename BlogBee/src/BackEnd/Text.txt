For centuries, doctors and scientists havetried to unlock the mysteries of the human brain. How is it organized? Which areas control different mental functions,and how is it all wired together to generate our subjective psychological experience? For the past 100 years, neuroscientists haveapproached the brain like map-makers, charting its features and activities within well-definedboundaries. The prefrontal cortex is celebrated as theseat of rationality. The motor cortex plans and coordinates movement. The somatosensory cortex and parietal lobescontrol our perception of the physical world. The temporal lobes process memories, language,and emotion. The occipital lobe processes and integratesvisual information. And the cerebellum helps execute our body’smotor commands. Scientists have looked at the brain throughthe lens of our beliefs about what it means to be human. So when we're looking at parts of the brain,trying to figure out what they do, scientists are usually using their beliefs about whatmakes a human mind, and some of those ideas you can trace all the way back to Plato. Recent studies of traditional categories ofcognitive brain functions, like memory, show surprising amounts of activity that overlapdifferent parts of the brain – so much that the simple map and its strict categories losetheir meaning. The way that we've been conceptualizing themind doesn't map very well at all to the functions of different systems in the brain. These kinds of distinctions are very subjectiveand it's probably better to try to look at the brain and figure out what its organizationalproperties are without appealing to these culturally ladened categories, which aren'trespected by the brain. Russell Poldrack is doing just that. At his lab at Stanford University, he’staking a computational approach to understanding the organizing features of our mind. If you have people perform a bunch of differentpsychological tasks that vary in the psychological functions that we think they engage, let'scollect a bunch of data on a bunch of different tasks and ask the data what kind of structurethere is. Poldrack's lab used machine learning to tryto isolate neural activity related to memory recall. But rather than simply mapping into memorycenters, the data correlated with more general constructs of activity — ones for whichwe don't yet have names. What that has shown us in some cases is thatthings that we might've thought were measuring the same thing really don't seem to be measuringthe same thing at all. I think we need to fundamentally rethink howwe conceptualize the functions of the brain. Within neuroscience, there's a broad agreementthat the brain is a computational machine and we need to understandwhat the computations are that it's doing, and that we should be able to ultimately understandpsychological function in terms of those computations. Part of the challenge is that we don’t havea great language for describing those computations other than math. So it raises essentially a question of whetherwe're going to end up with models of the brain that are really good at predicting the activityof the brain, but that we can't sort of give human understandable explanations to. Deep in the jungles of Southeast Asia livesthe world’s strangest flower. This is Rafflesia arnoldii. It’s affectionately known as the “corpseflower” because it smells like rotting meat to attract pollinating flies. It’s the largest flower in the world, withthe size and weight of a small child. But the weirdness doesn’t end there. Rafflesia is not just a flower—it’s aparasite. They require part or all of their nutrientsand water from another plant. As a result, we often find alien genetic materialin the genome of a parasitic plant—many times from the host. One of the hypotheses is that parasitic plantssteal from the host as a weapon to make them a better parasite. Liming Cai is the latest of a long line ofbiologists to attempt to sequence Rafflesia’s notoriously unwieldy genome. Biologists struggled because the Rafflesiagenome features highly repetitive elements called transposons, known as jumping genesfor their ability to cut and paste themselves at repeating intervals. Most organisms silence these elements, butRafflesia is not most organisms. These highly repeated elements [are] causinga lot of problems for a scientist trying to assemble genomes because it's basically likeputting a jigsaw puzzle, but every piece is identical. This year, with the help of a bioinformaticsteam, Cai successfully created a draft genome for a species of Rafflesia. Her findings were even more shocking thanbiologists had expected. There are a couple of things going on herethat really sort of blew my mind in the first place and really make us rethink what definesa plant. So all plants have a similar set of genes. In Rafflesia, what we found is that it haslost nearly half of the conserved plant genes, which is really a record-breaking finding. Cai also found that 90% of Rafflesia’s genomeconsists of repeating DNA, like transposons. That’s highly unusual. No one knows why, but the answer may transformour understanding of parasite genomics. With the advances of genome sequencing technology,we can explore all the weird branches of the tree of life—how rules can be bent by allsorts of really creative strategies. Life is really diverse and nature often surprises. In the early 20th century, sleep became apopular topic for researchers. The weapon of choice was the newly inventedelectroencephalograph, or EEG, a machine measuring electrical activity in the brain. This approach produced many insights, butit also set up a bias in the studies: that sleep is a neurological phenomenon, and itspurpose and structure is located in the brain. Everybody has thought that sleep is of thebrain, by the brain, for the brain. This is a famous quote by Alan Hobson, who'sa brilliant sleep scientist that made some huge contributions to the field. But it really overlooks the fact that, infact, we're not brains. We’re organisms, we’re integrated. Everything we do is integrated with everythingelse. The first cracks in this brain-centric viewstarted to show when the Swiss scientist Irene Tobler noticed that cockroaches sleep. Since then, we’ve learned that simpler creatures,with less and less brain, also sleep. And recently, a new discovery has changedthe narrative entirely. This is a hydra. It’s one of the simplest forms of animallife. Instead of a brain, hydras have nerve nets,the most basic nervous systems in nature. This year, a group of Japanese scientistsdemonstrated that hydras sleep. These tiny fresh-water organisms are livingproof that sleep evolved before brains. But if sleep didn’t evolve in and for thebrain, what is it for? More and more scientists are really lookingin peripheral tissues and asking how the body can impact the brain and how the brain canimpact the body specifically with respect to sleep regulation. In my lab, the current hypothesis is thatthere are some situations that the brain can't fix itself. And in association with whatever damage hastaken place, sleep can lower the activation energy to have these circuits begin to findthat solution. So the idea then is that when you're asleep,you're using less energy, but the energy that you are using, you're using in a differentway that you're supporting functions that you would not be able to otherwise supportif you were awake. The research on hydras is the latest in agrowing body of evidence that sleep first evolved to help regulate metabolism and enhancerepair, and only later took on brain-related functions. I really do believe that sleep and metabolismare intertwined. So that's going to be the future.
