Hinduism the religion of over a billion people is the world's oldest religion and probably the most confusing one to non-hindus some say it isn't even a religion more a way of life Hindus themselves call it the sanatana-dharma the eternal tradition so what is Hinduism does viola applied them and who is this elephant guy well let's find out [Music] Hinduism is the world's oldest active religion it's the result of the merging of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and the nomads that came into India around 1500 BC some scholars say could even go back many more thousands of years but we won't delve too deep into dates because dates in Hinduism are fairly very controversial but one thing is certain Hinduism is old like at least 36 Betty White's Hinduism has been around for so long that it and the concept of India itself are inseparable Hindu and India even come from the same word Sanskrit was the ancient language of the Hindus and the Sanskrit name for the Indus River is Sindhu the ancient Persians who sat across the Indus tended to switch their s's to H s so Sindhu became Hindu so the people living across the river became Hindus the Persians told the Greeks who dropped that ferry not Greek like H stuck in a fairy Creek like ear to the end and boom India Hinduism has a long long history but today we'll be focusing on just the core beliefs of Hindus because I don't have the willpower to animate tree arrow long video Hindus are a diverse group so restrict dedicating their lives to prayer while others don't believe in any gods but still follow Hindu philosophy to make things easier to understand let's break Hinduism down into seven core beliefs so here's my rap that the seven Hindu beliefs fine here's the regular version then one belief in one universal soul Hindus believe in a universal soul known as Brahman a formless genderless source of all reality Brahman is the universe and the material that makes up the universe it's a trippy concept but think of Brahman as an ocean and everything else as drops propelling out of that ocean separate for a time but still the same thing that makes sense to belief in an immortal individual soul in Hinduism souls are known as Atma actions of the soul while in a body have effects on that souls next life when you die your soul moves to another new body this is called transmigration the kind of body the soul inhabits next is determined by karma tree belief in karma karma is action usually good or bad actions that affect society for Hindus karmic actions in the past affect us today and our actions today affect our souls future for belief in moksha the goal in hindu life is to some help get back to Banamine if a hindu can do this they will be freed from the cycle of life and death this is called moksha you can achieve moksha by realizing your oneness with Brahman how you realize this is up to you for this reason Hindus pray lead me from the Unreal to the real 5 belief in the valus the Vedas are Hindu sacred books of knowledge there are 4 valence Hindus believe that all forward divinely revealed to ancient Hindu sages will take a closer look at the Vedas in a while 6 belief in cyclical time for Hindus there are no beginnings or endings time is a series of cycles each cycle containing four ages our use is accreta the treta the dawah Lapera and the kali added together the four use total about 4.3 to million years at the end of each cycle declining human morality leads to the total destruction of reality Hindus believe that we are in the fourth and final youg Kali seven belief in Dharma Dharma is a difficult word to translate to English proper behavior is the best that I could come up with Dharma maintains balance in the universe as long as everything in the universe like animals plants and humans follow their Dharma and everything will be fine if they break from the Dharma though things will be super not fine each beam has its own Dharma Alliance Dharma is to kill and eat antelope a king's Dharma is to rule well a subscribers Dharma is to smash the like button and ring the notification bell for humans their specific dharma is usually based on their age and their caste an old priest will have a very different dama than a young merchant for example so those are the seven core beliefs of Hinduism with them you can understand the Hindu mindset unlike Christianity or Islam Hinduism is a non-profit organization there is no Jesus or Mohammed for Hindus there is no Bible Koran or Torah instead they have a bunch and I mean a bunch of different sacred texts the four Vedas form the basis of the Hindu faith so let's take a look at them one the Rig Veda the Rig Veda is a collection of songs that praise and discuss ideas like truth reality and the universe along with discussions and war weddings and rituals to the Yahoo Veda the Ayurveda covers stuff such as sacrificial rites and rituals tree the sama Veda sama literally means sweet song that destroys sorrow it is mostly songs dedicated to praising gods it's different than the rest of the Vedas because it's set to music for the atharvaveda the attire of a Veda is my favorite one do you want to curse your enemies our charm that special someone maybe learn to invoke rain or discover herbal medicine along with tips on warfare like how to make poison arrows well this Veda has you covered along with a bunch of other charms and curses it even has a curse against cursors avoid us Oh curse as a burning fire avoids a lake strike him here that curses us as the lightning of heaven the tree and link to the atharvaveda is in the description just in case you need a spell to get a wife or another to banish pigeons from your presence it's it's great after the Vedas come to Upanishads which are like a sequel that makes the original make much more sense they were probably written down between 800 BC and 500 BC during a time when some Hindus started to the Vedas their ideas became the Upanishads Upanishads are books on philosophy like we would expect from Plato or Aristotle they're all about questioning doubt debate and finding the answers to life's difficult questions a theme in the Upanishads is that people are not their minds or bodies or egos but they're Atman your soul is you everything else is unreal and temporary after the holy texts like the Vedas and Upanishads are other less divine but still important texts these include stuff like the Puranas the Bhagavad Gita and Jeremiah and the Mahabharata the Puranas are like encyclopedias of Hindu beliefs there are 18 well-known Puranas the Puranas cover things from yoga to army organization to taxation to the caste system to hell guards and everything in between the bhagavad-gita get over short is one of Hinduism's most important texts the gita takes place on a battlefield where arjuna a great warrior refuses to fight lord krishna steps in to urge a unit to fight and their discussion covers things such as dharma and how to live your best life Arjuna eventually fought after Lord Krishna taught him the truth about Dharma as a member of the warrior caste a Yuna's Dharma was to fight against evil the lesson of the Gita is that everyone faces difficult choices but they must on them according to their Dharma no matter how unpleasant along with all these philosophical texts Hinduism has two action-packed epics jeremiah and the Mahabharata jeremiah the early of the two texts tells the story of Prince Rama in the epic you find out about his 14-year long exile the abduction of his wife Sita his battle with the evil demon Ravana and his awesome monkey sidekick Hanuman the second epic the Mahabharata is a longest poem in the world five times the length of the Bible and eight times the length of the Iliad and Odyssey combined it rivals any soap opera you've ever seen when it comes to drama murder betrayal love love murder and giant battles the Mahabharata has it all the theme willing true their Amaya and the Mahabharata is that Dharma must be followed for society to function in Hinduism there are four goals a person should aim for to have a good life the first of these is Dharma followed by artha the pursuit of prosperity and good reputation kama pleasure both in body and in mind and a moksha release from the cycles of rebirth Hindus should practice artha and kama with Dharma in order to achieve moksha there are also six temptations Hindu should try and avoid kama lost and materialism this camera is different from the good camera mentioned above I know Nexus cruda which is anger loja which is greed maha which is unrealistic attachment to things people and power mother which is pride and mattes area which is jealousy by following their Dharma and avoiding these six temptations a Hindu can break the cycle of rebirth and have their soul merge back into Brahman but even though everything comes from Brahman who is the one real thing in Hinduism Hindus do after all have thousands of gods so let's take a look at them first there's Brahma the Creator he created everything in the universe but he is not the universe itself because that's Brahman they aren't the same thing that last letter changed a lot apparently he has four heads the heads face each of the four directions to represent the four Vedas which he created and the four Yuke's he also holds a book which represents knowledge oh and he rides a giant Swan because he's just fancy his consort is Saraswathi the goddess of learning Vishnu the preserver is the second member of the Hindu Trinity he preserves the world created by Brahma until is eventually destroyed by Shiva he holds a discus which he used to cut down anyone that hasn't messed with his Dharma along with a conch which symbolizes victory and the five elements Vishnu has many many avatars such as Krishna or Rama who he uses to defend Dharma on earth oh and he rides a giant eagle named Garuda Vishnu has two consorts the Goddess Lakshmi and Boo Devi boo Devi is the earth goddess and Lakshmi is the goddess of good fortune and wealth next is Shiva the destroyer the third member of the Hindu Trinity it's his job to destroy the universe in order to prepare for its renewal at the end of each cycle of time the most identifiable of his features is his third eye which he almost always keeps closed if he does open it and you're in front of them then you will have your face melted off when not on making existence Shiva enjoys long walks with his bull named Nandi at the end of the Kali Yuga the fourth age of the world Shiva will perform a dance that destroys the universe which is odd because people have told me that my dance moves make them wish the world would end so me and Shiva have quite a lot in common Parvati and sati are Shiva's consorts Shiva also has two sons Ganesha and Murugan Ganesha is the worship as the remover of obstacles and Murugan is the God of War Ganesha holds a very special place in the heart of Hindus due to him being the remover of obstacles the elephant head is the most obvious clue to identifying him he was actually born with a human head but after Shiva cut that one off he kind of had to make do with an elephant one if you're Christian or Muslim you're aware that your religion has a bunch of different denominations like Catholics or Protestants Sunni and Shia Hinduism has these two Hindus developed four major denominations some of which have their own subdivisions the Vicodin Ava's primarily worship Vishnu and Chavez primarily worship Shiva and his sons smart does follow sacred texts like the Puranas Jeremiah and the Mahabharata rather than the Vedas they worship five gods and goddesses Ganesha Durga storia Shiva and a preferred avatar of Vishnu finally Schachter's worship the goddess Devi chapter C Devi as the ultimate and eternal reality like a feminine Brahman even though there are all these variations and more the core beliefs of hindus remain mostly the same hindus believe that dharma keeps the balance in the universe if the scales between good and evil start tipping towards evil then something needs to intervene to fix the universes dharma this divine intervention is known as an avatar the literal meaning of the word avatar is descent avatars are gods that descend to earth to intervene whenever help is needed to restore Dharma for example when the earth was dragged underneath the ocean Vishnu descend to earth as the avatar of raha a bore and dragged the earth back out in other cases Vishnu was born on earth as a human avatar like Rama or Krishna where he spent his avatars life fixing Dharma so the caste system if you only know one thing about Hinduism this is probably it people see it as an oppressive system that locks people in place based on their birth and for a huge part of history that's all it's been unfortunately let's do a quick explanation of what the caste system is in Hinduism there are four castes or classes that you can be born into there's the Brahmin the priest the Kshatriyas the Warriors the vicious the traders and the sudras the manual laborers the main basis for the caste system can be found in the back by Geeta and the Rig Veda Krishna says in the Gita I have created a fourfold system in order to distinguish among most qualities and functions the Rig Veda also refers to the forecast it says humans were created from parts of the God Purusha the Brahmin from his face the Kshatriya from his arms the Asia his thighs and the shudra his feet this system was supposed to assign people functions based on their abilities not their birth if someone had the qualities of a Brahmin or a visa they could fill those roles the Gita didn't restrict movement among castes and the caste system functioned as intended for a while until a document known as the laws of Manu came about around the fifth century BC popularly referred to as the Schmidty day created hard rules for hindu life - rules presented in it contributed to the way the caste system turned out man who state that the Brahmin were the Lords of all castes and he forbid moving among the castes the cash you were born into was now the caste you're stuck in if you give humans a hierarchy that exploited and things will go sour pretty quickly as time passed hindus began thinking in terms of upper and lower castes soon cleaning toilets tanning leather and dealing with meat products were thought to be impure the people doing those jobs became Untouchables the lowest of the low a people without caste and the rest is history the modern world has brought many changes though now Hindus mix freely while working together in the same businesses attending the same schools and generally just living together Bona comes to marriage many Hindus still stick to their own caste but this too is changing and on Hindu dating websites you can actually see people list a non-preference forecast it'll say caste no bar so those are the basics of Hinduism it isn't even close to covering everything one video simply can't do it Hinduism is too diverse too deep and means too many different things to different people but learning even the basics of this fascinating an ancient religion gives us an insight into the worldview of over a billion people and I hope you enjoyed it you can find all the sources used in the description below if you
