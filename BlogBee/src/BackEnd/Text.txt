on mission day nobody could sleep you're hyped you're scared to death this is not taking an airplane ride right the idea was to land in a particular spot on the moon we were pretty confident about everything except for that last part which was the powered descent [Music] we've known each other all this time and we actually have lunch once a month together we're just buddies now I decided my senior in high school when to be a programmer and about my junior year in college I decided I was gonna work for IBM when I first worked in Bethesda Maryland I lived on Pennsylvania Avenue just right down the street from John Kennedy and he said we're gonna put a man on the moon and I went oh gosh that sounds like a great idea at that time we thought we were pretty hot stuff with a thousand words of memory on a drum and and so forth me you wrote these programs with a pencil in an eraser you go into our building you'd see people running around at two o'clock in the morning with these boxes and all these cards in there and it was sort of a combination of art and science Gale flight controllers go/no-go for landing retro when I knew that the spacecraft was a hundred feet above the ground we quickly determined that Neil Armstrong was doing power mode 4,200 Konerko for landing over he was flying it like a helicopter above the ground trying to find a good place to land get ice water in his veins I stayed calm stay cool stay collected how did your boss be it went up my take is he had around 20 seconds left of fuel or he would have had to abort I remember pray dear Lord just help him put it down just put it down in about 15 seconds later you put it down first off you feel this enormous relief that it actually worked and nothing I did screwed up I don't think then you go crash but Kevin slept in three days it's early and the fact that matter is we'd have never gotten to the moon and we didn't ever land it and we didn't ever come home safe if it hadn't have been for the IBM hardware and software and Operations Support it couldn't have been done man cannot think that fast the computers could and we could build them and we did I had a two-year-old son and I had a daughter who was 2 months old and so I took both of them outside and I took my son and said Greg look at the moon you looked at the moon while men walked on it and I remember that just as if it happened yesterday I think it's pretty clear that at the time in 1969 IBM took a major risk in working with NASA the number of things that could have gone wrong in that mission are enormous I think it says a lot about IBM and IBM errs we solve problems we love to solve problems the bigger the better and that's what IBM is all about we are a trusted partner for some of the most difficult problems in the world [Music]
