the Middle East is a house designed by Europeans but sat on the foundations of the Ottoman Empire its monarchies ministries and militaries aped those of Europe and for several decades that did provide stability but now the regions in crisis and it's the chaos caused by a new mutation of political Islam that's the first point in understanding this Arab regimes across the region have failed on economically politically secures on the security front they have failed to form a regional structure any form of permanent prosperity of or stability absent some form of channel where the Arab public can actually get involved in governance Islamism has been the only gateway so are the old ideologies embodied by Baathist or military leadership stead and buried and will an Islamic caliphate sweep all before it we don't know yet but we do know that this new wave of Islamist politics is a threat to elites and states across the region there's another thing that's become clear to that trying to drop another Western construct liberal democracy into the current cauldron of the Middle East simply isn't going to work for now at least the so-called Arab Spring is going nowhere in some places like Iraq it's being trumped by the politics of identity whereas the old authoritarian Ottoman model ruled by the Pasha or General has shown its resilience in Egypt and Algeria but where the old strongmen are swept away Qaddafi Saddam fragmentation has followed and that means old borders coming into question too the most obvious example has been the erasure of the Syria Iraq border by Isis which now proclaims its new Sunni state the Kurds have got in on the act too pushing forward their historic quest for statehood Libya also is in danger of fragmentation with the East ancient Chiron Aika now already largely separate so are the states contrived by the European colonial powers nearly a hundred years ago doomed quite possibly but don't forget that even in Iraq or Libya there are still leaders who aspire to control of the whole not just some rub statelets you find a tenacious commitment to the state as the unit of primary identity now there are a lot of other identities going on there religious ethnic as well but the state survives and the state survives as the unit of primary identity across the whole of the region and don't forget that other hangover of British rule Israel there's been a hundred-year argument about its existence and borders and at times like now that conflict can inflame the whole region but new forces are coming into play new alliances in fact emerging in the Middle East where as outsiders are happy to sell weapons to these power brokers regional players are key so Iran has made itself the guardian of the Shia forging a power bloc with Hezbollah in Lebanon President Assad's regime in Syria and increasingly the rump state of Iraq Saudi Arabia champions the Sunni Arabs pouring resources into the Syrian opposition and it's cash has made a client of Egypt to the Saudis are not necessarily fighting the Iranians based on religious foundations in part this is a traditional conflict between two very important regional powers rich States very significant influence fighting over controlling the Middle East at a time when the u.s. is disengaging but this isn't just a simple binary saudi-iranian contest Saudi Arabia's will has been floated by Qatar also Sunni backing Islamists in Egypt and Gaza Israel too makes its own rules some dare I mentioned Tony Blair say the West must take sides and ally with the Saudi bloc the more general Western attitude is to steer well clear should we in the West be worried yes and deeply because there is turmoil in the Middle East and it's likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future and whether or not we want to get involved we will be affected this is going to come back to bite you if you think of the huge trouble of turning of the United States and indeed the international community turning its back on Afghanistan leading to the birth of al Qaeda and a transnational jihadi movement it took days for a young jihadi tourists to move from Europe to Afghanistan it takes hours basically a charter flight to Turkey and across the border to get into Syria so clearly this problem is going to come back and bite Europe especially hard but also the United States growing chaos in Libya or Iraq could raise energy prices and hit economic recovery refugees from Syria or Libya flee to the EU airspace is becoming unsafe over big chunks of the region and as for the uncovered space that is also opening up in several countries it provides a potential home for piracy extremism and perhaps even the next 9/11
