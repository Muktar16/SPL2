So, as you’ll recall from our previous episode, a declining Europeanpopulation due to disease and war in the 14th century meant that labor had become much morevaluable, which shifted long-held beliefs about how society should be organized.Amid all this upheaval, and to some extent because of it, the Florentine author FrancescoPetrarca, aka Petrarch, was unleashing his critique of 14th century life. “Living,”he lamented, “I despise what melancholy fate/ has brought us wretches in these evilyears.”[i] Oh, Petrarch, are you sure you weren’t writingabout now? It’s almost like people always feel like they live in the worst possibletime. At any rate, not happy with the state of thingsin Europe, he turned to Plato, Cicero, and other ancient writers, whom he thought ofas residents of the Old Age. In fact, Petrarch gave the era in which helived its name--calling them the “middle ages” just as his writing and research helpedusher in a New Age that we now call the Renaissance. [Intro]According to Renaissance author Leonardo Bruni in the early fifteenth century, “FrancescoPetrarch was the first with a talent sufficient to recognize and call back to light the ancientelegance of the lost and extinguished style.” The Renaissance, meaning revival or renewal,harkened back to what was seen as the bright light of classical antiquity, which had thenbeen obscured in the dark and ignorant Middle Ages.But in some ways, the Middle Ages existed simultaneously with the Renaissance. Likejust as scholars were reviving translations of Plato and integrating knowledge from theIslamic world, the bubonic plague went on killing people;and in Petrarch’s hometown, ordinary people like the Ciompi were vigorously protestingliving conditions. Which brings us to an old question here at Crash Course: Was the Renaissancereally a thing? Was it in fact just a continuation of the medieval world? Or was it the dramaticchange that Renaissance thinkers believed it to be?The writers and thinkers of the Renaissance scoured monasteries for ancient works, initiallywritten or at least influenced by Roman writers. It was from this manuscript-hunting--especiallyfor works by Cicero, and Tacitus, and Quintilian--that Renaissance scholars began to focus on so-calledhumanism. That is to say, they became more interested in worldly and human concerns.And because the Renaissance really was a revival, this new thought was based on learning aboutold or ancient ways, especially in the study of the “humanities”. The three liberalarts of grammar, rhetoric, and logic, led to the so-called sciences of theology, philosophy,laws, and medicine. The study of the humanities as developed bythe ancients focused not on the heavens or saints but on human speech or rhetoric, humanlogic, and the correct use of language. And by language, of course, they mostly meantLatin--being able to write in Latin and even perform Latin orations was seen as key toa fully educated life, as every high school Latin teacher will be happy to tell you.Competence in these fields was seen as crucial to developing the self and a prerequisitefor joining Florentine or Venetian elites. Like, Venetian youth Lauro Quirini, for example,studied the humanities at the University of Padua and then was sent to work in a Venetianenterprise on Crete, fully prepared for his new job as a commodities trader, althoughhe also worked as a translator and a writer. You might say he was a real Renaissance Man.I’m sorry. The Italian city-states were the heartlandof the early Renaissance. In these prosperous cities, artists, composers, writers, and scholarsthrived along with the commerce that paid for everything.Urban merchants and manufacturers built a brisk business that brought in products andideas from around Afroeurasia. And some families achieved immense wealth, which allowed themto support the world of Renaissance thinkers and artists in a system called patronage.I would like a phenomenally wealthy patron like Lorenzo Medici. If any of you are outthere, I am available. And I would like all your ducats.You can visit patreon.com/crashcourse. But at any rate, banking institutions also sprangup, and bankers funded civic events and the construction of lavish cathedrals. Bankers also backed or personally paid forthe building of masterworks in the classical style--that is, in the style of the restrained,stately design of the pre-Christian Roman Empire. Did the Globe open?Is there a neoclassical piggy bank in the center of the world? There is!You know all those white statues of the renaissance that take their whiteness from the white statuesof the ancient Greeks and Romans? Yeah, they were not white!They were painted. Like, here are some of our best guesses of what actual classicalstatues looked like, and as you can see, not very much like neoclassical white piggy banks.Nonetheless, the idea of unpainted marble, or porcelain, or whatever has proven so powerfulthat even though we now know that ancient statues were painted, we still don’t paintour neoclassical ones. Bankers also financed artists needing fundsto complete their works, including Botticelli and Michelangelo. And city governments themselves were alsoimportant patrons of the Renaissance, while individual leaders often spent as muchas six percent of their personal income on the arts.Why? Well, largely for the same reason rich people fund art and buildings today--for status,for recognition, and maybe even for the love of beauty. But also, funding public art andcathedrals and the like served to legitimize the wealth of these families. The Church couldnot very well condemn merchant wealth if it was used to build churches, nor could thegovernments that came to depend on it. We see this again and again throughout history--wealthsupports institutions that in turn legitimize that wealthRegardless, in these artworks, you can see the paradoxes of the Renaissance-- paganismis combined with Christianity, as it often had been throughout Christian history. Profit-orientedbankers financed the Church, which was run by priests who’d taken a vow of poverty,and founded by a figure who in the gospels overturns the tables of moneylenders in thetemple. Also, In these city-states, access to a morehumanistic educational approach helped boost economic growth and fueled the creation ofmuch art and architecture that is still really influential.Now, many city states participated in this humanist revival, but its headquarters wasundoubtedly Florence. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.1. Artists of the time were following ancient styles and taking them further.2. Visual artists, like Sandro Botticelli and Michelangelo, 3. focused on human dignity and realisticdetails. 4. Botticelli’s portraits of Florentinecitizens display the distinct features of his subjects, 5. while his depictions of religious individualsshow, for example, a plump infant Jesus realistically reaching for his mother’s garments. 6. Botticelli’s portrait of the long-deadDante similarly displayed his long, thin, and pointed nose 7. rather than some idealized, formulaic hero. 8. And Michelangelo’s “David” presentstruly human characteristics 9. even as it sought to copy ancient sculpturalstyles. 10. Across the spectrum of Renaissance art,anatomical accuracy flourished, 11. which you can see in Michelangelo’ssculptures 12. and also in the work of fellow FlorentineLeonardo da Vinci-- 13. both artists, incidentally, were ableto render the human form in part because they both dissected cadavers.14. And nature, as a setting for humans and thus humanism, was also glorified in Renaissanceart, 15. as you can see in the Birth of Venus.Botticelli’s painting focuses on the mythical goddess from the classical world 16. but at the same time she’s about tobe clothed in the flowers found in the natural world of the countryside. 17. In short, the artists of the Renaissancefocused on situating a realistically depicted human body 18. in both its natural environment and itscivic setting. Thanks, Thought Bubble. But amid this prosperityand cultural revival, Florentine history was marked by a succession of economic and naturalshocks, class divisions, corporate rivalries, party struggles, conflicts with the church,and especially political crises. And those arose from threats of external invasionas well as internal tyranny and discontent among the lower classes.Like Venice, Florence took great pride in being a Republic, although it was a bit differentfrom contemporary republics and exceedingly unstable.Like, there weren’t really elections; instead, names of members of Florence’s guilds wouldbasically be drawn out of a large leather bag, and if your name was drawn, you got toserve on the Signoria, which ran the city. And if you weren’t psyched about the job,no worries--new Signorias were chosen every two months, which might make it seem likelots of people were able to participate in civic life, but 1. In order to be a memberof a guild, you needed to be debt-free and male and well-connected,and 2. in truth the lotteries were often rigged, with wealthy families tending to win placeson the signoria. Also, there were frequent coups and countercoups,and the Republic would often cease to be republican and at times become downright Monarchical.It was all quite Games of Thronesy--one might even say that it was a bit Machiavellian.And no wonder--the political theorist Niccolo Machiavelli did live in Florence.We’ll discuss him more next week, but for now, it’s important to know that he saw--andsuffered through--much of this turmoil, including the rise and fall and rise again of the Medicifamily. The Medicis were tremendously powerful in Florence, although contrary to what youmight read they weren’t the only important family in the Renaissance.But they did make huge sums in banking and investing, and were important patrons to artists--infact Michelangelo carved one of their tombs. Cosimo Medici and his grandson Lorenzo dominatedthe second half of the fifteenth century, in Florence, while successive members of thefamily perpetuated its power and patronage by serving as popes in the next centuries.Machiavelli argued that the Florentine Renaissance’s Golden Age ended with the death of Lorenzode Medici in 1492 and the invasion of the “barbarians.”Of course, “Barbarians” mostly means “Not Us” throughout history--in fact the worditself comes from a feeling that the language of Barbarians sounded like bar bar bar barbar. Anyway, these particular Barbarians were French, so I guess it sounded like Bar. Iwasn’t very good at High School French. And so we return at last to the old question:Were there really broad shifts away from the religiofication of all aspects of Europeanlife toward the human and the secular in the Renaissance? Like, Michelangelo sculpted David,but he also painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.Perspective matters when you ask these questions--something important and new was happening in 14th centuryFlorence (and Venice and Milan and so on) among merchants and intellectuals. But thelives of average people, especially peasants, were not much transformed by this humanistthinking--at least not in the short run. But in other ways, ordinary people did alsohave a Renaissance--ancient authors were translated into Italian and French, which allowed thosewithout access to Latin to read Cicero and the like. But of course most Italian peasantscouldn’t read anything. Historians also debate whether women experienceda Renaissance. Women were among the patrons of the arts: Isabella d’Este sponsored musicalevents and loved Petrarch’s poems so much that she had music composed for them. Shealso sponsored painters, maintaining contacts with Leonardo da Vinci.But, Isabella d’Este and her similarly accomplished sister Beatrice are often seen as the exception.In general men, according to fifteenth century writer Laura Cereta, discounted women’sintellectual worth. Deliberately following Petrarch’s path ashe had followed Cicero’s, Cereta wrote a famous letter to one misogynist that readin part: “I cannot tolerate your having attacked my entire sex. . . . With just causeI am moved to demonstrate how great a reputation for learning and virtue women have won bytheir inborn excellence, manifested in every age as knowledge. . . .”[ii]Also, the rise of Roman legal thinking meant the rise of the Pater Familias. The idea thatthe father is the center of every family, and also the center of power.All of which is to say that the Renaissance saw tremendously important developments inthe intellectual and cultural life of Italian city-states, developments that would soonbe exported to other communities. But we have to be able to shift perspectives--tothe Medicis, the Renaissance was a thing. To many peasants, it was not. We rememberthe Renaissance today partly because it’s helpful for historians to periodize historyto frame their analyses, and partly because so much Renaissance thinking shapes our thinking.And I think it’s worth remembering how the ideas of the Renaissance continue to resonatefor us today. Consider, for example, the feeling that the current age is so full of corruptionand destruction that we must return to the purity of some bygone era of greatness. ThatRenaissance thinking seems very relevant, indeed. Thanks for watching. I’ll see younext time. credits SourcesHunt, Lynn et al. The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures, 6th ed.
