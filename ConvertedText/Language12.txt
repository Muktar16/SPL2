hi hello
hey how's it going yeah pretty good okay
so welcome to the company it's your
first day i will help you on board
so the first thing you want to do is
download the code base so go ahead and
clone the git repository
can you see my screen
yeah now i see it
easy i know how to do this all right so
now you want to go ahead and
install npm node git vs code or you can
use any ide you want
then you want to use your email to sign
in to confluence for documentation azure
devops jira and github you got that
yeah it's it's just downloaded yeah
perfect so we're a pretty diverse
company we use multiple technologies
here so you want to go ahead and also
install
python java c c plus plus
and once you get that code base set up
you want to go ahead and use the command
line to directly install linux
typescript javascript and set up the
configurations i won't show you that
because you know it's
it's just you know it's pretty simple so
yeah do you have any questions
yeah i think your screen is loud all
right so no questions
perfect you seem to be pretty bright
i'll give you your first task right away
it's pretty basic you know just to get
your feet wet so basically you're gonna
fix this button okay that's not too bad
and then you want to make this button
interact from front to back and it
should make exactly 7.5
api calls and return the data to the aws
cloud wordpress which is our middle end
but you want to make sure it doesn't
bottleneck so add some multi-threading
in the javascript
and um are you familiar with machine
learning no yeah you probably are right
new kids are really good with that stuff
nowadays so maybe just add a little bit
of
unsupervised classification and we can
you know cluster the html attributes and
if you really want to go above and
beyond
you can also use bootstrap to strap
everything together at the end
you know just pretty simple i have to
jump in on another call so don't
hesitate to ask me if you have any
questions
and you'll be done with this in like one
hour right so i'll see you then good
[Music]
